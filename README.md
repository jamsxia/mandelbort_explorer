"The Mandelbrot set (/ˈmændəlbroʊt, -brɒt/)[1][2] is the set of complex numbers {\displaystyle c}c for which the function {\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c}{\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c} does not diverge to infinity when iterated from {\displaystyle z=0}z=0, i.e., for which the sequence {\displaystyle f_{c}(0)}{\displaystyle f_{c}(0)}, {\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))}{\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))}, etc., remains bounded in absolute value."

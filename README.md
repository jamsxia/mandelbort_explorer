Basically, what this programe does is to show the mandelbort set in the form of dynamic image by using pygame library

The final function includes 

(1)drawing this mandelbort set with distincts colors depending on their steps of achieveing infinity

(2)zoom in and out to help users futher observe specific domains for this set

(3)gradually draw the picture after zooming in or out because the picture is too precise and may cost for a while to form a complete image, in this process, a rough picture should be brought about first

(4)crop pictures and test
